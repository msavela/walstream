# TypeScript gRPC Client Example

This example demonstrates a simple gRPC client in TypeScript that connects to the stream server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

## Running the client

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the client and compile protobufs:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Alternatively, you can run the client in development mode without a separate build step:
```bash
npm run dev
```
